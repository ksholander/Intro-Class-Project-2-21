Web Overview
======
# Client / Server Architecture
![client server web architecture](Intro-Class-Project-2-21/images/client_server.png)
* **Client**
  * Renders pages within a browser
  * Stores small amounts of local data in cookies or local store
  * Executes client side scripts within browser sandbox
* **Server**
  * Runs web server software such as Apache
  * Responds to requests by sending pages (HTML) and images
  * Executes server side scripts to generate custom page content
  * Able to store large amounts of data in server database

# Anatomy of a Web Page
* **HTML _(HyperText Markup Language)_** - Carries the page content
  * Text
  * Hyperlinks
  * Images (actually links to images)
  * Markup language, not programming language
* **CSS _(Cascading Style Sheets)_** - Describes the page appearance
  * Rules that pair content with style
  * Allows different rules for different media (small screens, large screens, printers, etc)
* **JavaScript** - Programs the page behavior
  * A C-like object based programming language
  * Runs within the browser
  * Can be used to define navigation behavior, validate form inputs, and control page animations
* **Website** - A bunch of web pages glued together with hyperlinks

# Examples
  * [Google](http://www.google.com)
  * [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com)
  * [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)
  * [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com)

Development Environment
======
  * Browser (obviously)
    * Chrome

      Open source browser developed by Google. Available across most platforms (Windows, iOS, Linux). Includes very powerful debugging tools for developers. This browser enjoys the largest marketshare amongst all browsers and is a good choice for primary development.
    * Firefox

      Open source browser developed by Mozilla (based on the old Netscape Navigator). Plugin developer tools are available. Runs on most platforms. Second most popular browser after Chrome. Make sure to test all of your websites in both Chrome and Firefox at a minimum.
    * Safari

      Apple's native browser, also available for Windows and Linux machines. This browser is not very popular outside of Apple machines, but with the popularity of iPhones, it is especially important to test on this browser when designing sites targeted at mobile devices.
    * Internet Explorer

      Microsoft's browser, which now includes fairly decent developers tools. Due to continuous deliberate inconsistancies programmed into the browser (mostly to increase MS competitive advantage), this browser has fallen out of favor with most users and developers. Still controls about 15% market share, so cannot be overlooked entirely.
  * Text editor (__NOT__ Wordprocessor)
    * [Brackets](http://brackets.io)

      Designed specifically for web development using web technology. Much more than just a text editor, this tool integrates CSS style previews, JS lint checking, page previewer and debugger, and source code management all into one Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)

      Free download for evaluation. License requires purchase for continued use.
    * [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org)

      Free, open source editor for MS Windows machines
    * [Vim](http://www.vim.org)

      An improved version of the vi editor that ships with most UNIX/LINUX systems. Very powerful and flexible editor with a very steep learning curve. Not for the faint of heart.
    * Notepad - junk. Do not use
  * Debuggers

    A debugger is a tool that helps developers by exposing the inner workings of the scripts, HTML, and CSS, so that problems, odd behaviors, and bugs can be easily tracked down and fixed
  * Server Software and Database

    In order to fully test the behavior of a website, it is important to see how the site will perform on an actual server. Depending on your development machine, LAMP (Linux), WAMP (Windows), or MAMP (iOS), are available as open source, free downloads. These applications convert your computer into a fully functional, Apache based web server with MySQL database.
